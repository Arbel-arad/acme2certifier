# Generic CMPv2 protocol handler

The CMPv2 protocol handler is not bound to a specific CA and implements the ['cacerts'](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030#section-2.1) and ['simpleenroll'](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030#section-2.2.1) calls as defined in [RFC7030](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030).

when using the handler please be aware of the following limitations:

- Authentication towards CA server is limited to ClientAuth as described in [RFC7030 section 3.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7030#section-3.3.2) 
- Revocation operations are not supported

The andler has been tested with the following EST implementation:

- [Insta Certifier](https://www.insta.fi/en/services/cyber-security/insta-certifier)


When using the Cisco test server make sure that the csr generated by your acme-client has a valid common-name. So enrollment by using cert-bot is unfortuately not possible.
